This is a remake of Spice 9's Multiliveries addon. While he is away, studying for his exams, noone is contributing to his extension (https://github.com/Spice9/Geofs-Multiliveries/blob/main/Multiliveries.js) I made one that will actively be updated. 
If you want to add, just add an issue, and basically follow the same thing that the otherone did.
